## Problem 1

What is the difference between `<span>` and `<div>`?

**Solution**

The `<span>` HTML tag is an inline container, whereas the `<div>` HTML tag defines a division or block in an HTML document.

## Problem 2

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

**Solution**

See [`fizz_buzz.go`](../pkg/fizz_buzz.go).
